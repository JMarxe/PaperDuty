# Description:

It is required to develop a business case for an information technology **innovation** of their choice. In this assignment, the main objective is to explain the applications and features of a NEW technology to a business investor or a company and defend it using some criteria. The required criteria and items for the new technology presentation:

- **Do a Feasibility study (Cost and benefit analysis)**

[**https://www.pagerduty.com/blog/7-benefits-of-incident-management-in-supporting-applications/**](https://www.pagerduty.com/blog/7-benefits-of-incident-management-in-supporting-applications/)

- **Why is it a reasonable investment? For instance, is managerial revenue more than costs?**

The result: Below is a snapshot we created based on the results of IDC's research, in which we assume a team of 10 IT staff using PagerDuty. Using these assumptions, on average, organizations would save over $350,000 a year in staff productivity per 10 IT staff when using PagerDuty as their digital operations management platform.

<br />

Total cost per year (x12): **$108,766**

Total cost per year before PagerDuty: $465,319
Total cost per year after PagerDuty: $108,766
Total savings per year with PagerDuty: $356,533

The IDC analysis also examined the benefits various operational teams experienced and found that:

- IT infrastructure, IT security, and customer support teams realized 16%, 8%, and 10% efficiency gains, respectively
- DevOps teams realized 23% higher productivity
- Overall, IT troubleshooting staff realized 11% efficiency gains

### Factors Driving ROI

What drives a lot of this amazing ROI is a mix of improvements to the performance and productivity teams responsible for managing digital operations. This, in turn, results in improved uptime, a better customer experience, and revenue protection.

Specifically, performance and productivity improvements come from reducing alert noise and decreased downtime. One customer shared that "the ability to identify noise from real critical issues and a reduction in mean-time-to-resolution (MTTR) were factors. Before, we had all alerts, high and low [priority], coming in via email. Since we moved everything to PagerDuty, we have seen a 50% reduction in MTTR year-over-year."

Another customer shared that they saw a 30% reduction in P1 and P2 incidents in just six months, which improved their customers' experiences overall.

Finally, one customer highlighted that their teams are happier because they are no longer awakened at night for no reason and also have more time to look into why issues are happening, enabling them to become much more efficient at addressing incidents when they do happen.

Ultimately, on average, the organizations interviewed by IDC realized the following annual average benefits:

- IT staff productivity benefits of $2,551,000 ($9,400 per 100 IT users)
- Business productivity benefits of $613,000 ($2,200 per 100 IT users)
- Risk mitigation/user productivity benefits of $396,000 ($1,500 per 100 IT users)

<br />

When you add it all up, these PagerDuty enterprise customers averaged $3.56 million in annual business value savings ($13,100 per 100 IT users per year), amounting to what IDC refers to as "a substantial three-year ROI of 731%" with a payback period of only 4.3 months.1

- **Break-even point (estimated)**

It's hard to say the breakeven point with PagerDuty because PagerDuty is saving IT companies more than they realize. Companies that implemented PagerDuty had a drop in total cost annually with a significant amount of money to invest in other departments like Human resources, Research and development, marketing, sales, customer service, accounting, and finance. If we use $13,100 per 100 IT users annually, companies will have thousands to millions of dollars saved.

- **Competitive analysis: why is it better than other alternatives?**

PagerDuty delivers a reliable and robust capability for scheduling on-call coverage, routing alerts and events from monitoring tools to the right people, managing escalation, allowing teams to customize the alerting and event management process, and bringing that experience to a mature mobile app that makes many users happy. The vast number of integrations and the ability to use the API to connect to more than 300 other systems. The incident response capability includes such SRE best practices. Runbooks use machine learning to identify redundant and duplicate events, suggest actions for resolution, and inform everyone related to the incident what is happening.

PagerDuty is incredibly easy to set up and use. Creating new teams, on-call schedules, and escalation policies can be done in minutes. You can go from manually looking up people via a google calendar or an excel sheet to engaging an on-call resource in 2 minutes or less from the great app while you are on the beach. The integration with Slack is excellent and valuable for incident notifications for those teams that rely heavily on Slack.

PagerDuty provides different ways of notifying the user: Via email, SMS, or call. The best thing about their software is that if the user responds to the ticket on the PagerDuty portal within a specified time, it will send the user an SMS. If the user still is unresponsive to the ticket, a call will alert the user to work on it. This process ensures that high-criticality tickets are noticed. In this way, breaches are avoided from any attacks.

When looking at other companies, PagerDuty had better pricing compared to other companies like Dynatrace, xMatters, Freshservice, Jira Service Management, Datadog, ServiceNow, and many more.

- **Consider the challenges and drivers.**

[**https://www.getapp.com/it-management-software/a/pagerduty/reviews/**](https://www.getapp.com/it-management-software/a/pagerduty/reviews/)

- **On-call management is a critical responsibility to ensure 24/7 customer support. However, employees on-call are usually working outside of normal business hours which can burn out employees. If a team takes on the burden of resolving incidents, they won't have the capacity to do their day jobs as well. It is unfair to have employees work normal business hours as well as after hours. Thus, it is challenging to have employees take on the role of maintaining the services they build. Not all employees are motivated by money, thus offering more money to developers to work-after hours may not be effective.**

- **Innovative features: why is it an innovation? What is new about it?**

[**https://www.pagerduty.com/blog/pagerduty-ecosystem-highlights-at-aws-reinvent-2022-check-out-our-partnerships-aws-integrations-and-win-prizes/**](https://www.pagerduty.com/blog/pagerduty-ecosystem-highlights-at-aws-reinvent-2022-check-out-our-partnerships-aws-integrations-and-win-prizes/)

- **Defensible in a management meeting (Provide some statistics, financial and nonfinancial evidence, and proof to defend the technology in front of the management team. For instance, providing quantitative data to show how technology can reduce errors and improve productivity?)**

The Business Benefits Are Clear:

- The PagerDuty platform helps customers improve across the incident response lifecycle by increasing efficiency, alignment, and productivity across disparate teams. IDC reports the value of this to be $2,447,878 per organization.
- Customers also use PagerDuty to integrate incident management across business teams, such as customer services, enabling them to deliver a better experience for users and customers. IDC calculates the value of this at $679,973 per organization.
- In addition, our customers have reduced the frequency and risk of outages and downtime using PagerDuty, meaning higher employee productivity and less revenue loss. IDC quantified the value of this at $352,319 per organization.

Incident-Related Benefits Driving ROI:

- The IDC analysis shows these annual savings are being driven by improvements in the time it takes to identify and troubleshoot incidents, with customers reporting a 74% reduction in unplanned downtime.
- These time savings and productivity gains allow teams to focus on driving innovation. For DevOps, PagerDuty is helping teams to focus on developing new applications and features instead of firefighting. Overall, DevOps teams that use PagerDuty are 27% more productive, allowing them to develop 16% more new applications without adding staff or outsourcing development.
- Customer Support teams are 10% more efficient because they can leverage information shared from PagerDuty in real time on digital incidents. This helps frontline customer service agents proactively manage customer issues and deliver a better experience.
- Organizations also reported that PagerDuty is allowing IT infrastructure management teams to spend more time on higher-value projects instead of firefighting, with teams reporting an efficiency improvement of 18%.

- **How to solve current issues using the new technology**

- With the emergence of new technologies, a lot of customers rely on these services more than ever before. An outage within these technologies can affect millions of customers. Customers expect an immediate response to bugs, downtime, etc. An on-call management system, such as PagerDuty, ensures the right people are available to address problems for any incident.

- **Adoption and implementation issues**

- Teams may have trouble adopting PagerDuty as it requires clearly defined responsibilities across teams. It's most logical to have developers take on responsibility for the products that they build, as they have most of the knowledge for that specific product. However, this leads to an unfair distribution of responsibilities leading to a schedule where employees can't completely detach from work. Additionally, shifting the responsibility to someone who is unfamiliar with the system may result in a longer resolution period.

**Important Note:**
